# Contributing

We love contributions to InnerComponents! To help keep misunderstandings to a minimum, we have a few guidelines if you contribute to the project.

---

## Bugs
If you find a bug, first check if its not already reported. Bug reports happen through github issues. If you find a bug please make sure it has the following:

* **A Descriptive description** - The description should be descriptive and clearly describe what the bug is.
* **As much information as possible** - You should include as much information about the bug as possible. Including: Reproduction steps, what happens, ect.

## Suggestions/Feature Requests
Aditions of components **Do not** count as suggestions nor feature requestions. Please scroll below for information on that.

Suggestions include things like newer functions or API's, property aditions, or updates to existing logic.

Make sure you are the first one to suggest it and then make a github issue. Make sure your feature request answers the following:

* What is the issue, how does this solve it?
* Code examples of how this could be used.
* Reasons why this should be added.

Keep in mind it should not:
* Be specific to your project.
* Shorten existing already understandable code (There can be exceptions to this rule!)

## Design improvements
InnerComponents is built on top of the InnerDesign system. Keep in mind design updates arent taken lightly and often require changes and updates throughout the entire module.

Please keep in mind InnerDesign is heavily built upon imitating Roblox Studio's UI. This is because InnerDesign is intended for use within plugins, and it helps create a more intuitive user experience.

## Contributing Components

Thanks for wanting to contribute components to InnerComponents. Please make sure your component follows the following:

* **Non specific to your project** - You are **expected** to make some components for your project, its just part of developing UI.
* **Follows the style guide** - Components should all follow the same style guide to keep everything part of one codebase.
* **Customizable** - Components should have *Many* props for users to control.
* **Reactive props** - All props should be reactive, even props that in pretty much all situations shouldnt update, should still be reactive. This is to create an improved user expeience and more consistancy within the module.

## Contributing code
Please remember you should create a issue before a pull request when contributing code for a new feature. Pull requests should always close an issue!
