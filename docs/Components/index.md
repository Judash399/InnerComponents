# Components

Components are reusable parts of UI that you can put together to make a complete UI.

Here you'll find a list of every single component in *InnerComponents*. Each component has 2 parts:

* *API* - This goes into the properties for a component and how you can configure them
* *Guidelines* - Specfic guidelines on how to use a component correctly.

If you are here just for the component guidelines, we recomend also reading through the [Guidlines](../Guidelines/) first to get a basic understanding of the core design rules.
