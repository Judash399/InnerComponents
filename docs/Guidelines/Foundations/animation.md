# Animation

Animation is the process of adding motion to a design to provide feedback. In *Inner Design* Animation is used to create a more intuitive user experince. Animations follow the following rules:

## Everything doesnt need animation :lucide-video-off:
Everything doesnt need an animation. Its better to keep your designs simple and static.

* Animate in response to a users action.

## Quick and simple :lucide-fast-forward:
Animations should be fast and straightforward rather than complicated. 

* Animations shouldn't slow down the overall use of an app.

## Non-Frame rate dependent :lucide-film:
Animations must complete inthe same amount of time for **all users**, regardless of frame rate.
