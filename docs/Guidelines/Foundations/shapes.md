# Shapes and Icons

In *Inner Design*, shapes always follow the following rules:

## No Circles :lucide-circle-off:
*Inner Design* fundamentally doesnt use circles. This rule is being partially questioned, and may be removed. Lucide icons do not count towards this rule.

## Rounding :lucide-square-round-corner:
All shapes are rounded, there are never hard corners. A minimum of 6 pixels corner radius is used for **All** components.

## Icons :lucide-logo:
Icons are part of the [Lucide Icon pack](https://lucide.dev). For the case of custom icons, they should *always* follow [their style guides](https://lucide.dev/guide/design/icon-design-guide).
