# Shapes and Icons

In *Inner Design*, shapes and icons always follow the following rules:

## Rounding :lucide-square-round-corner:
All shapes are rounded, there are never hard corners. A minimum of 6 pixels corner radius is used for **All** components.

## No Stroke :lucide-brush:
Shapes **DO NOT** have stroke around them. They always are one color.

## Icons :lucide-logo:
Icons are part of the [Lucide Icon pack](https://lucide.dev). For the case of custom icons, they should **always** follow [the lucide style guide](https://lucide.dev/guide/design/icon-design-guide).

## No Filled Icons :lucide-paint-bucket:
This is to emphasize *Lucide*'s rule. **There are no filled icons in *Inner Design*!**
