# Color

Color exists to communicate meaning of elements while letting the personality of your app shine. In *Inner Design* color is used to comunicate state, hierarchy and user feedback. 

## Color should exist for a reason :lucide-brush:
Color should only be used to communicate meaning. Color should not be used only for decoritive purposes.

<div class="admonition-row" markdown>

!!! do "Do"
    Use color to indicate state, importance, or user feedback.

!!! dont "Don't"
    Don't add color just to make a layout feel less empty or more "interesting".

</div>

!!! tip
    If removing the color doesn't change meaning, it likely doesn't belong.

## Palettes :lucide-swatch-book:
In *Inner Design* You define colors to use through a color palette. Colors should not differ from this palette unless absoultely necessary for the functionality of your app.

## Accent Color :lucide-pipette:
When defining a color pallete most colors should be pretty much colorless, this is to put emphasis on your apps *Accent*. 

!!! dont "Don't"
    Don't overuse the accent color. It should be used sparingly to put emphasis on important elements.

## Feedback :lucide-message-circle:
Change the color of an element, or use the accent color to give feedback to the users current action.

* Feedback should never rely on color alone.

## Gradients :lucide-audio-waveform:
Gradients shouldn't be used in most situations, flat colors will always do.

!!! dont "Don't"
    Gradients shouldn't be used directly on static elements like frames.
