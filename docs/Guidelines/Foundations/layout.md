# Layout

Layout is how elements are arranged to create hierarchy and flow. In *Inner Design*, layout rules exist to make interfaces easy to understand at a glance.

## Hierarchy :lucide-layers:
!!! info "What is Hierarchy?"
    Hierarchy is a mental diagram of importance, from most to least important.

    In design, it’s used to communicate what the user should notice first, second, and last in an interface.

The Layout of elements should clearly communicate what is and isnt important.

<div class="admonition-row" markdown>

!!! do "Do"
    Use size, spacing, and placement to show importance.

    Primary actions and content should naturally draw the eye first.

!!! dont "Don't"
    Don't give everything equal visual weight.

    When everything looks just as important, it can confuse the user, making your designs no longer "Invisible".

## Spacing / Padding :lucide-align-vertical-space-around:
Spacing is used to group related elements and separate unrelated ones.
